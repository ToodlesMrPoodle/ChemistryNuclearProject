        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>
          Smoke detectors were made accidentally by Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger, working on a way to detect poison gas. His device failed and Jaeger in frustration lit a cigarette, the smoke from the cigarette moved the meter on his device. His accidental discovery led to the commercial use of the modern smoke detector that we all use today in our homes. 
        </p>

        <p>
          After many years of the invention being passed around by many scientists and inventors, the first “modern” smoke detector came to be. Duane Pearsall along with Stanley Bennett Peterson created the first “modern” smoke detector that was battery powered in the mid 20th century.

        <h2>Relation to Nuclear Chemistry</h2>

        <p>
          Most of the commonly used smoke detectors use one μCi (microcurie) or less of americium-241.

        <h2>Notation</h2>

        <p>
          ²⁴¹₉₅Am
        </p>

        <p>
          ²⁴¹₉₅Am → ²³⁷₉₃Np + ⁴²He || ALPHA

        <h2>Usage of Smoke Detectors
        </h2>

        <h3>Three Types</h3>
        <p>
          Photoelectric detectors
        </p>
        <p>
          • There is a light source that is directed towards a sensing chamber, when smoke enters the detector, it redirects the flow of the light towards the sensor, causing the detector to go off
        </p>
        <p>
          ‎
        </p>
        <p>
          Ionization detectors
        </p>
        <p>
          • Contains a small amount of radioactive material and when smoke enters the detector, it disrupts the flow of the ions, causing the detector to go off
        </p>
        <p>
          ‎
        </p>
        <p>
          Dual detectors
        </p>
        <p>
          • A combination of both Photoelectric and Ionization
        </p>

        <h3>Advantages </h3>
        <p>
          • Might save you
        </p>
        <p>
          • Certain smoke detectors are able to send alerts to higher authorities such as Fire Stations in chance that it goes off
        </p>
        <p>
          • If maintained properly they will work 24/7
        </p>
        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        <p>
          • Super loud; Constant beeping when low on battery
        </p>
        <p>
          • Photoelectric sensors requires constant monitoring and maintenance
        </p>
        <p>
          • Ionization sensors are very sensitive which can cause false alarms (radiation concerns as well)
