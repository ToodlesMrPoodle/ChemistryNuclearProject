        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>
          Smoke detectors were made accidentally by Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger, working on a way to detect poison gas. His device failed and Jaeger in frustration lit a cigarette, the smoke from the cigarette moved the meter on his device. His accidental discovery led to the commercial use of the modern smoke detector that we all use today in our homes. 
        </p>

        <p>
          After many years of the invention being passed around by many scientists and inventors, the first “modern” smoke detector came to be. Duane Pearsall along with Stanley Bennett Peterson created the first “modern” smoke detector that was battery powered in the mid 20th century.

        <h2>Relation to Nuclear Chemistry</h2>

        <p>
          Most of the commonly used smoke detectors use one μCi (microcurie) or less of americium-241.
        </p>

        <h2>Notation</h2>

        <p>
          ²⁴¹₉₅Am

          Alpha Emitter <br>

        <h2>Usage of Smoke Detectors
        </h2>
        <p>
          • Detecting smoldering fires and flaming fires.
        </p>

        <h3>Three Types</h3>
        <p>
          Photoelectric detectors
        </p>
        <p>
          • There is a light source that is directed towards a sensing chamber, when smoke enters the detector, it redirects the flow of the light towards the sensor, causing the detector to go off<br>‎
        </p>
        <p>
          Ionization detectors
        </p>
        <p>
          • Contains a small amount of radioactive material and when smoke enters the detector, it disrupts the flow of the ions, causing the detector to go off<br>‎
        </p>
        <p>
          Dual detectors
        </p>
        <p>
          • A combination of both Photoelectric and Ionization
        </p>

        <h3>Advantages </h3>
        <p>
          • Might save you
        </p>
        <p>
          • Certain smoke detectors are able to send alerts to higher authorities such as Fire Stations in chance that it goes off
        </p>
        <p>
          • If maintained properly they will work 24/7
        </p>
        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        <p>
          • Super loud; Constant beeping when low on battery
        </p>
        <p>
          • Photoelectric sensors requires constant monitoring and maintenance
        </p>
        <p>
          • Ionization sensors are very sensitive which can cause false alarms (radiation concerns as well)
        </p>

        <h2>Future of Smoke Detectors</h2>
        <p>• May become smart enough to determine different levels of smoke, from cooking steam to actual fire smoke.
        </p>
        <p>• It could become able to differentiate the type of smoke that it detects such as carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide.
        </p>
        <p>• Have the chance to be able to determine if there is anyone in the room as well for maximum safety, minimizing the time from the sensor going off and the reaction from the person.
        </p>

        <h2>Arguments
        </h2>
        <p>
          We are for Smoke Detectors because not only do they keep you and anybody in the house safe from fire and smoke hazards, any affects that may occur from radtiation will not happen as it’s radiation levels are very low.<br>‎
        </p>
        <p>
          Radiation Levels
        </p>
        <p>• Smoke detectors give off about 1/100 of a milirem of radiation per year, such little dose wouldn’t affect you.<br>‎
        </p>
        <p>
          What if I have 100 smoke detectors?
        </p>
        <p>• 1 mrem of radiation won’t affect you either, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) only allows exosures up to 5,000 mrems per year for those who work around radioactive materials, and 500 mrems for civilians.<br>‎
        </p>
        <p>
          What if I have 100,000 smoke detectors?
        </p>
        <p>• The average smoke detector costs $25, meaning that you would need $2,500,000. If possible, you would receive 1 rem yearly, but either way the NRC won’t allow you to have that many.
